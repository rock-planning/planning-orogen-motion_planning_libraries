/**
 * \mainpage MPL - ROCK Module
 *
 * \section Introduction
 * This describes the MotionPlanningLibraries ROCK Module and its integration 
 * into a small navigation stack.
 * 
 * \section MPL-Module
 * Within the MPL library documentation you can find an instruction how to 
 * setup the configuration struct.
 * \a planning_time_sec defines the maximum time which should be used for planning
 * during each call of the updateHook.
 * 
 * The test module can be used to generate test traversability maps. See the test_planning script
 * for an example.
 * 
 * \section nav_stack Small Navigation Stack
 * The following image shows the ROCK modules which are required to set up a small navigation stack.
 * The GraphSlam module uses the odometry and the Velodyne laser scanner data to create a MLS map
 * and to calculcate the pose of the system within the GraphSlam frame. The created MLS
 * is converted into a traversability map which is used from the MPL-Module for planning. The 
 * current pose of the robot defines the starting pose and an additional goal pose
 * has to be provided. The planned trajectory is passed together with the current pose 
 * to the trajectory follower which generates a Motion2D command (containing forward and
 * rotational speed) which is sent to a specific robot-controller which converts
 * the Motion2D cmmand into motor commands. 
 * \image html simple_navigation_rock.jpg "Simple ROCK navigation stack"
 * 
 * \section start Execute Small Navigation Stack
 * To execute such an navigation stack deployments have to be created containing all relevant modules. 
 * In the following example all tasks are combined within one deployment.
 * \code{.unparsed}
 * using_task_library 'odometry'
 * using_task_library 'velodyne_lidar'
 * using_task_library 'graph_slam'
 * using_task_library 'traversability'
 * using_task_library 'motion_planning_libraries'
 * using_task_library 'trajectory_follower'
 * using_task_library 'robot_motioncontroller'
 * 
 * deployment 'example_deployment' do
 *     task("odometry", "odometry::Skid")
 *     task("velodyne", "velodyne_lidar::LaserScanner")
 *     task("graph_slam", "graph_slam::VelodyneSLAM")
 *     task('traversability', "traversability::Simple").triggered
 *     task("planner", "motion_planning_libraries::Task").periodic(1.0)
 *     task("follower", "trajectory_follower::Task").periodic(0.01)
 *     task("controller", "robot_motioncontroller::Task").periodic(0.01)
 * 
 *     add_default_logger
 * end
 * \endcode
 * 
 * After the deployments have been created a Ruby script can be used to start the navigation stack.
 * \code
